🚀 DSA With Java
Welcome to my repository dedicated to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms using Java! This repository serves as a personal log of my journey through LeetCode problems, coding challenges, and fundamental computer science concepts.

📌 Roadmap
Basics: Java Syntax, Time & Space Complexity (Big O)
Linear Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
Non-Linear Data Structures: Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hash Tables
Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms
📂 Repository Structure
The code is organized by topic to make it easy to locate specific implementations:
